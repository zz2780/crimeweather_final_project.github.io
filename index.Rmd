Based on the Lombroso's Theory of Crime, natural climatic factors can influence crime rates. The Extreme temperatures sap one's energy and reduce the passion for crime. The suitable temperatures stimulate one's nerve like alcohol and makes it easier to commit criminal acts in an excited situation.

In fact, the weather in criminology covers many aspects. Apart from the weather itself, it also involves the seasons as well as the temperature. All of these natural events occur in the spatial and temporal dimensions and recur with regularity from year to year constitutes a season. In order to fully discuss the changes of crime rates in the time dimension, we also consider the changes in crime rates at different times of the day and on different days of the week.

# Dataset
Our project used the public datasets with information on public safety and Climatology Network. The [NYPD Complaint Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243) includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for all complete quarters so far. In our project, we select the records from 2016-01-01 to 2017-12-31 to do analysis and modeling.

The [Global Historical Climatology Network ](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html) integrates daily climate observations. Meteorological elements include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation. We selected weather data collected from 2016-01-01 to 2017-12-31 from three weather stations in New York.

# Methods
The NYPD Compliant Data contains 780 million felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 1910 to 2021. Weather data is collected from the website of NOAA using the Global Historical Climatology Network. 

We selected key variables and renamed them with understandable names for both datasets, then we combined the two datasets based on date. Exploratory analysis was first conducted to investigate if there is an association between crime counts and weather including min/max temperature, precipitation and snowfall. We also conducted statistical tests and final model fitting. Visualization including interactive map and Shiny dashboard is also included in the analysis. Anlyses were conducted in R version 4.2.1.

# Main Results

Based on the Chi-squared test, the distribution of number of crimes cases of each month is significantly different between 2016 and 2017.

Based on the one-way ANOVA, The average number of crimes per day is correlated to weather.

We can build a model to predict daily crimes cases.

We already know that weather may influence crimes from previous analysis. So we 
decided to build a model to predict daily crimes cases. We proposed following
models:

* Model1: total_crime ~  day_of_week + mean_tmax + mean_prcp + mean_snow
* Model2: total_crime ~ month +day_of_week +  mean_tmax + mean_prcp + mean_snow
* Model3: total_crime ~  month +day_of_week +  mean_tmax + mean_prcp + mean_snow + mean_tmax*day_of_week
* Model4: total_crime ~ mean_tmax + mean_prcp + mean_snow

We use cross validation to compare the four models and performed a diagnostics 
and we concluded that Model3 is the best and it meet the model assumptions. 
We should select month, day of week, maximum temperature, precipitation, snow depth 
and a interaction term between temperature as our predictors.

# Discussion

We established 4 models aiming to predict how weather contributes to crime occurrence in NYC, and chose a final model with cross validation and assumption diagnostics with standard criterions of linear regression. Model 3 is our best model because it has the lowest RMSE value among all models. Months (excluding October and December), day of week (excluding Friday), average precipitation, average snow fall are a series of predictors that affect crime occurrence with negative slopes. Months (October and December), average maximum temperature, and the interaction terms between average maximum temperature and days within a week are a series of predictors that affect crime occurrence with positive slopes. Since days within a week alone have negative slopes, while their interaction between average maximum temperature are having positive slopes, a higher temperature may have more to do with higher crime occurrence. To illustrate, research articles has confirmed that a slight raise in average temperatures will increase violent crime rates when other contributing factors are constant (Tiihonen et al., 2017). This can be seen in the Month predictors as they are less negative in May, June, July, August, and September. 

However, there is a inconsistency in the Month predictors because October and December are having positive slopes, while November has a slope of -1.06 which is higher than the slopes of May-September. This may be caused by other factors that are not included in our datasets, such as holidays -- our guesses are people may tend to commit more crimes during holiday seasons for money, and there are more people out of town/visiting neighborhoods that they are not familiar with, which led to problems. This may also be a result of data sampling error because our dataset only included data from 2016 and 2017. The slopes are very likely to be changed when we enlarge our sample. 

The strength of our model is demonstrated by its relatively lower RMSE (24) in cross validation, which represent certain accuracy of the model in predicting the response comparing to the rest of our models. 

Limitations exist in our model. First, as we mentioned above, our data were collected from 2016 and 2017, which is not representative of the overall crime tendency in NYC. In addition, our model only included factors that is weather/temperature relative, and the well-established factors affecting crimes -- such as poverty and mental health issues, are not included or controlled at baseline in our study. Stratification of demographical factors is necessary for accuracy. Furthermore, since our aim is to predict the occurrence of crimes based on weather, a goodness of fit should be evaluated carefully for such prediction. Other selection criterions like Mallow's Cp and adjusted R^2 may be included in the model validation process. It is also important that a logical selection procedure is strictly followed for statistical model selection. Some variables may be log-transformed to become more effective, and multicollinearity should be assessed to check for confounders. In our model, such selection and assessments were not done. These suggest that our model may lack some level of accuracy.
